# Boilerplates 

## React-Vite-TypeScript

A common starter with React, Vite and TypeScript

### Notes

- This starter uses these pre-commit tools :
    * [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)
    * [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged)
    * [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
    * [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- There is a basic CSS reset, including the most useful settings (like "box-sizing: border-box;")
- Vitest is used for the tests and they will run in pre-push.
