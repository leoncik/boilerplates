# Boilerplates 

A little collection of starters for frontend projects.

## Simple HTML

- [bare-bones](https://github.com/leoncik/boilerplates/tree/bare-bones) : The most basic structure for a project. Useful for quick tests and messing around. No dependency.

## React

- [react-vite-typescript](https://github.com/leoncik/boilerplates/tree/react-vite-typescript) : A complete React starter using Vite and TypeScript. Several dependencies are added in order to ensure code quality (linter, tests and code formatter).
